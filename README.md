# GithubJourneys

GithubJourneys is an archive of markdown file resources, that teach people how to get started with certain technologies, and useful bits of information that I wish we knew myself when I first started developing. It leverages my past conversations I've had with github copilot as a means to squeeze important educational content from them.
