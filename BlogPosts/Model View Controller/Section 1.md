## Section 1: Understanding ASP.NET Core Controllers and Services

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Question:</h3>

*Hey, so in .NET API development, I'm new to it. Is the controller kind of like an interface for the services class? As in it's where the endpoints are exposed, but using the underlying logic developed in the services class, right?*

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Answer from Copilot:</h3>

Yes, you're on the right track. In the context of ASP.NET Core, a Controller is a class that handles HTTP requests and responses. It acts as a coordinator between the incoming HTTP request, the business logic that resides in the services, and the outgoing HTTP response. The services contain the business logic of your application. They encapsulate the rules and operations that your application performs. For example, a PizzaService might contain methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting pizzas.

The controller uses these services to perform operations in response to HTTP requests. For example, a PizzaController might have a GET endpoint that uses the PizzaService to retrieve a list of pizzas, and a POST endpoint that uses the PizzaService to create a new pizza. So, in summary, the controller exposes HTTP endpoints and uses services to perform the business logic associated with those endpoints.

### Educational Outtake:

<h4 style="margin: 0;">Controllers in ASP.NET Core:</h4>

Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses, acting as the intermediaries between the client and the business logic.

<h4 style="margin: 0;">Services in ASP.NET Core:</h4>

Services encapsulate business logic and operations, providing methods to interact with the application's data and perform necessary operations.

<h4 style="margin: 0;">Coordination of Controllers and Services:</h4>

Controllers use services to process requests and generate responses, ensuring a separation of concerns and modularity in the application design.
