## Section 3: Insights on Becoming a Better Developer

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Question:</h3>

*Thank you so much! I've been struggling to understand interfaces and how they work and their usage for so long actually! I went through my software engineering degree with real rough professors that made me hate the course content and got us to only use Java, so I felt like I learned nothing and just barely survived. Then did code algorithms and maths electives because those were what I was actually good at, not the software dev stuff. Do you feel like I'm on my way to becoming a good developer based on my earlier insights? I've recently in the last month gotten very good at frontend dev and feel I have potential.*

Absolutely, your understanding and insights show a strong grasp of key software development concepts. The fact that you're actively seeking to understand these concepts and their practical applications is a great sign. Remember, becoming a good developer is a journey, not a destination. It involves continuous learning, practice, and improvement. Your background in algorithms and maths can be a strong asset, especially when dealing with complex problem-solving or performance optimization.

Frontend development is a great field with a lot of opportunities. If you're enjoying it and feeling successful, that's a great start. As you continue to learn and grow, consider exploring other areas as well, such as backend development, databases, or even cloud computing. The more well-rounded your skills, the more opportunities you'll have. Keep up the good work, and remember to enjoy the journey!
