## Section 4: Service as the Intermediary Between Model and Controller

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Question:</h3>

*But the controller wouldn't use a service to update the view, would it? Service to me sounds like the intermediary between the model and the controller.*

<h3 style="margin: 0;">Answer from Copilot:</h3>

You're correct. The service is typically used to handle business logic and interact with the model. The controller, after getting the necessary data from the service, would then directly update the view in a desktop application or send the data as a response in a web application.

In the context of your JavaFX application, the controller would use the service to get the new set of words (the data), and then the controller would update the view to display these words. In the context of an ASP.NET Core web API, the controller would use the service to get the data (like a list of pizzas), and then the controller would send this data as the HTTP response. So, the service is indeed an intermediary between the model and the controller, but it's the controller's responsibility to take that data and use it to update the view or form the HTTP response.

In both desktop and web applications, services handle the business logic and interact with models. Controllers then use the data provided by services to update views or form HTTP responses.

The controller's role is to use the data from services to either update the view directly (in desktop applications) or send the data as an HTTP response (in web applications).
